# Enterprise Watcher

A simple powershell script used to watch ArcGIS Portal Health check and report an email if failed.

Ensure you update config with the correct details.

This was tested and run using microsoft exchange as the smtp server
to run:
- open powershell
- cd to correct directory
- enter ./watcher.ps1 ./config.json email.domain.com


Note: more is needed to be done to document this. Havent had time yet.
